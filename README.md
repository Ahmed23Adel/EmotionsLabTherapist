# EmotionsLabPatient

EmotionsLabPatient is an innovative iPad application designed to help individuals with autism learn to recognize and understand emotions. This educational tool uses a combination of visual cues, interactive exercises, and gamification to create an engaging learning experience that addresses the specific challenges many people with autism face in emotional recognition.

## üéØ Purpose & Features

EmotionsLabPatient was developed with a focus on accessibility and educational effectiveness for individuals with autism who struggle with emotion recognition. The application provides:

- **Emotion Recognition Training**: Interactive exercises that help users identify and distinguish between different emotions through facial expressions and contextual cues.
- **Accessible Design**: Utilizes the Atkinson Hyperlegible font, created by the Braille Institute, which offers excellent readability for all users, including those with visual impairments. The font features clearly distinguishable letters, regular shapes with generous spacing, and minimal decorative elements.
- **Gamification Elements**: Incorporates missions, levels, rewards, and progress tracking to maintain user engagement and motivation.
- **Personalized Learning**: Adapts to the user's progress and provides encouraging feedback, with supportive messages like "If you fail, don't worry, try again!"
- **Visual Learning Aids**: Uses clear, consistent imagery with emotion labels to reinforce connections between facial expressions and emotion names.
- **Daily Notifications**: Reminds users to practice regularly, reinforcing learning through consistent engagement.
- **Customizable Experience**: Allows users to personalize their experience through settings and avatar options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The application was built using:

- **Swift**: The primary programming language for iOS/iPadOS development
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface with a declarative syntax
- **MVVM Architecture**: Model-View-ViewModel pattern for clean separation of concerns and maintainable code
- **AVFoundation**: For implementing audio feedback and sound effects to enhance the learning experience
- **Core Data**: For local data persistence and managing user progress
- **Keychain Services**: For secure storage of sensitive user information
- **Notification Framework**: For implementing daily reminders and engagement features
- **Combine Framework**: For reactive programming and handling asynchronous events
- **Authentication Services**: For user account management and secure access

## üìö What I Learned

Developing EmotionsLabPatient provided valuable experience in:
