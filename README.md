## üéØ Purpose & Features

EmotionsLabTherapist was developed with a primary focus on enabling therapists to effectively monitor and analyze the progress of multiple patients with autism who are learning to recognize emotions. The application provides:

- **Patient Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of each patient's performance across different emotion recognition exercises and over time.
- **Progress Analytics Dashboard**: Visual representations of patient data showing improvement trends, challenge areas, and comparative analysis.
- **Multi-Patient Management**: Centralized system to track and compare progress across the therapist's entire patient roster.
- **Period-Based Assessment**: Review completed therapy periods to evaluate effectiveness and make evidence-based treatment adjustments.
- **Latest Results Overview**: Quick access to the most recent performance metrics for immediate insights into patient progress.
- **Session History**: Detailed historical view of all completed sessions with performance metrics for longitudinal analysis.
- **Customizable Therapy Plans**: Adjust therapy parameters based on progress data to optimize learning outcomes for each patient.
- **Secure Patient Data**: HIPAA-compliant handling of sensitive patient information and progress metrics.
- **Professional Reporting Tools**: Generate progress reports for clinical documentation and sharing with caregivers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The application was built using:

- **Swift**: The primary programming language for iOS/iPadOS development
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface with a declarative syntax
- **MVVM Architecture**: Model-View-ViewModel pattern for clean separation of concerns and maintainable code
- **RESTful API Integration**: For secure communication with backend services to retrieve and store patient progress data
- **Data Visualization**: Implementation of charts and graphs for clear representation of progress metrics
- **Combine Framework**: For reactive programming and handling asynchronous data streams
- **Authentication Services**: For secure therapist account management and patient data access
- **Keychain Services**: For secure storage of sensitive information
- **Network Layer**: Custom API caller implementation for robust server communication
- **Date Management**: Advanced date handling for tracking progress over time periods

## üîÑ Relationship with EmotionsLabPatient

EmotionsLabTherapist works as the professional monitoring counterpart to EmotionsLabPatient:

- Patients use the EmotionsLabPatient app to complete emotion recognition exercises
- The EmotionsLabTherapist app collects and analyzes all performance data from these exercises
- Therapists use this data to track progress, identify patterns, and adjust treatment plans
- The system creates a complete feedback loop between patient activities and professional oversight
